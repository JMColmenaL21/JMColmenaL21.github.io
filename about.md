# About me
## Hello there!
Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Juan, and I am a robotics engineer on a mission to build the future of intelligent technology. As I embark on a master's program in AI, this space will serve as a showcase for my personal projects in both robotics and artificial intelligence. 
I'm excited to share how I'm exploring the synergy between these two fields to tackle complex challenges and create something truly impactful.
